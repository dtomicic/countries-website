## Project task
Project goal was to build out a website that pulls information from the countries API and displays the info. User should also be able to click on any country and get to a page with more detailed information about the selected country.

## Project overview
Seeing as this is my second React project I would say it went good, not perfect since there is still a lot of work to be done on the site (some countries won't show, redirect on some links etc.) but taking into consideration the size and complexity of the project I am satisfied with how it turned out with my still quite low React skills.
